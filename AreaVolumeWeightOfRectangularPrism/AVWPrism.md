This script takes an input for width, length, and height for a rectangular prism and returns the area

and volume to the user. It will then take an input for the weight of each unit of the cube, 

from there it will return the weight of a layer (unit weight times area) and then the weight of the 

whole cube (unit weight times volume), returning both results to the user.
